The park offers a diverse range of activities, including camping, hiking, cross-country skiing, and wildlife viewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key features of Banff National Park is its natural beauty, with rocky mountain peaks, glacial lakes, and abundant wildlife. Visitors can enjoy exploring the park's many trails, such as the Johnston Canyon Trail, Bow Falls Trail, or the Lake Louise Lakeshore Trail [Source 2]. It is essential to check the Trail Conditions Report before heading into the national park, as trail conditions can change frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banff National Park also offers a range of cultural experiences, including historic sites and museums. The park features several heritage buildings, such as the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel and the Banff Upper Hot Springs [Source 1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Visitors to the park should be aware of the park's rules and regulations, including restrictions on drone usage. Operating a drone within park boundaries is prohibited, and anyone caught doing so may face law enforcement action and a fine of up to $25,000 [Source 2]. Additionally, visitors should exercise caution when visiting water bodies during winter months, as thin ice can exist anywhere on the water. It is recommended to assess ice thickness and never go onto ice alone, with an ice thickness of at least 10 cm for safe walking and cross-country skiing [Source 3].\n",
